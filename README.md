## txt2md

A simple script for converting text files exported from my Kindle scribe to Github flavoured markdown

The script 'scribe2md.py does the actual conversion but may need some refining.

The script 'watch_scribe.py' will watch the directory 'Scribe' for new files and convert them to markdown which it then saves to the floder 'Markdown'.
